# RFM Segmentation Analysis for Pharmacy Clients
## Overview
This repository contains SQL Code and documentation for conducting RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation analysis on pharmacy client data. RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to analyze customer behavior based on three factors:

- Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases.
- Monetary: How much money a customer spends on purchases.
By segmenting clients based on these criteria, pharmacies can better understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
